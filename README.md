## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Proposed Solution

We propose to develop an AI-powered, multilingual Smart Crop Advisory System accessible through both mobile applications and voice-enabled chatbots. The system will:

Provide personalized crop advisory by integrating soil health data, weather forecasts, and crop history.

Offer AI-driven fertilizer and pesticide recommendations, ensuring sustainable usage.

Enable farmers to upload images of crops for automated pest/disease detection.

Deliver market price updates for better financial planning.

Support regional languages and voice commands for farmers with low digital literacy.

Ensure scalability, allowing integration with government schemes, agri-extension services, and local cooperatives.

Technical Approach

Technologies:

Backend: Python, Node.js

Frontend: React Native (for mobile app), Web dashboard for officials

AI/ML: TensorFlow/PyTorch for crop disease detection, NLP for multilingual chatbot

Cloud: AWS / Azure for scalable hosting and real-time analytics

APIs: Weather, market price, and government data APIs

Methodology:

Data collection (soil, weather, crop disease datasets).

AI model training for image-based pest detection and NLP chatbot.

Development of multilingual mobile app with voice assistance.

Integration with weather APIs and soil health reports.

Pilot testing with local farmers and feedback incorporation.

Feasibility and Viability

Feasibility: High, as required technologies are already available and open datasets can be leveraged.

Challenges:

Low internet penetration in rural areas.

Building accurate multilingual NLP models.

Farmer adoption due to low digital literacy.

Mitigation:

Offline mode with periodic sync.

Voice-based and icon-driven UI.

Local language support and community training programs.

Impact and Benefits

Social: Empowers farmers with reliable, localized knowledge.

Economic: Reduces input costs and increases yield, improving farmer income.

Environmental: Promotes sustainable farming practices, reducing chemical overuse.

Government/NGOs: Provides data insights for policymaking and targeted interventions.
